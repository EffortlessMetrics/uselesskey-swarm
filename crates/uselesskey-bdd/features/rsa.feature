Feature: RSA fixtures
  As a test author
  I want to generate RSA key fixtures
  So that I can test cryptographic workflows without committing secrets

  # --- Determinism ---

  Scenario: deterministic RSA fixtures are stable
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000042"
