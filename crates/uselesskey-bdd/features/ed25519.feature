Feature: Ed25519 fixtures
  As a test author
  I want to generate Ed25519 key fixtures
  So that I can test EdDSA cryptographic workflows without committing secrets

  # --- Determinism ---

  Scenario: deterministic Ed25519 fixtures are stable
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000042"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "signer"
    And I generate an Ed25519 key for label "signer" again
    Then the Ed25519 PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  Scenario: deterministic Ed25519 derivation survives cache clear
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "ed25519-seed-alpha"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "first"
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate an Ed25519 key for label "first" again
    Then the Ed25519 PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  Scenario: different labels produce different Ed25519 keys
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "0xdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "alice"
    And I generate another Ed25519 key for label "bob"
    Then the Ed25519 keys should have different public keys

  Scenario: different seeds produce different Ed25519 keys
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "seed-one"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "service"
    And I switch to a deterministic factory seeded with "seed-two"
    And I generate another Ed25519 key for label "service"
    Then the Ed25519 keys should have different public keys

  # --- Random mode ---

  Scenario: random factory produces different Ed25519 keys each time
    Given a random factory
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "ephemeral"
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate an Ed25519 key for label "ephemeral" again
    Then the Ed25519 keys should have different public keys

  Scenario: random factory caches Ed25519 within same session
    Given a random factory
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "cached"
    And I generate an Ed25519 key for label "cached" again
    Then the Ed25519 PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  # --- Key formats ---

  Scenario: Ed25519 PKCS8 DER private key is valid
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "format-test"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "der-test"

  Scenario: Ed25519 SPKI PEM public key is valid
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "format-test"

  Scenario: Ed25519 SPKI DER public key is valid
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "format-test"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "spki-der-test"

  # --- Negative fixtures: mismatched keys ---

  Scenario: mismatched Ed25519 public key is different
    Given a random factory
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "signer"
    Then an Ed25519 mismatched SPKI DER should parse and differ

  Scenario: mismatched Ed25519 key is deterministic
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "mismatch-test"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "victim"
    And I get the mismatched Ed25519 public key
    And I get the mismatched Ed25519 public key again
    Then the mismatched Ed25519 keys should be identical

  # --- Negative fixtures: corruption ---

  Scenario: Ed25519 corrupted PEM with BadHeader
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "corrupt-test"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "corrupted"
    And I corrupt the Ed25519 PKCS8 PEM with BadHeader
    Then the corrupted Ed25519 PEM should contain "-----BEGIN CORRUPTED KEY-----"

  Scenario: Ed25519 truncated DER fails to parse
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "truncate-test"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "truncated"
    And I truncate the Ed25519 PKCS8 DER to 10 bytes
    Then the truncated Ed25519 DER should have length 10
    And the truncated Ed25519 DER should fail to parse

  Scenario: deterministic Ed25519 PEM corruption with variant is stable
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "ed25519-det-corrupt-pem"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "ed25519-det-pem"
    And I deterministically corrupt the Ed25519 PKCS8 PEM with variant "v1"
    And I deterministically corrupt the Ed25519 PKCS8 PEM with variant "v1" again
    Then the deterministic text artifacts should be identical
    And the deterministic Ed25519 PEM artifact should fail to parse

  Scenario: deterministic Ed25519 DER corruption with variant is stable
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "ed25519-det-corrupt-der"

    And I deterministically corrupt the Ed25519 PKCS8 DER with variant "v1"
    And I deterministically corrupt the Ed25519 PKCS8 DER with variant "v1" again
    Then the deterministic binary artifacts should be identical
    And the deterministic Ed25519 DER artifact should fail to parse

  # --- JWK support ---

  Scenario: Ed25519 public JWK has correct format
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "jwk-test"

    And the Ed25519 public JWK should have alg "EdDSA"
    And the Ed25519 public JWK should have use "sig"
    And the Ed25519 public JWK should have a kid
    And the Ed25519 public JWK should have x parameter

  Scenario: Ed25519 private JWK has correct format
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "jwk-test"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "jwt-signer"

  Scenario: Ed25519 JWKS has valid structure
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "jwks-test"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "auth-service"
    Then the Ed25519 JWKS should have a keys array
    And the Ed25519 JWKS keys array should contain one key

  Scenario: Ed25519 kid is deterministic
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "kid-test"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "issuer"
    And I capture the Ed25519 kid
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate an Ed25519 key for label "issuer" again
    And I capture the Ed25519 kid again
    Then the Ed25519 kids should be identical

  # --- Key format completeness ---

  Scenario: Ed25519 produces parseable keys in all export formats
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "ed25519-all-formats-test"

    Then the Ed25519 PKCS8 DER should be parseable
    And the Ed25519 SPKI PEM should be parseable

  Scenario: Ed25519 JWK export has OKP type with Ed25519 curve and key material
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "ed25519-jwk-complete-test"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "complete-jwk"
    Then the Ed25519 public JWK should have kty "OKP"
