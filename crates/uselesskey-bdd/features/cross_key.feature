Feature: Cross-key validation failures
  As a test author
  I want to verify that wrong key types fail validation
  So that I can test error handling in cryptographic workflows

  # --- RSA vs ECDSA ---

  Scenario: RSA key has different JWK kty than ECDSA key
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cross-rsa-ecdsa-test"
    When I generate an RSA key for label "cross-rsa" with spec RS256
    And I generate an ECDSA ES256 key for label "cross-ecdsa"
    Then the RSA JWK should have kty "RSA"
    And the ECDSA JWK should have kty "EC"
    And the RSA JWK kty should differ from the ECDSA JWK kty

  Scenario: ECDSA key has different curve than expected
