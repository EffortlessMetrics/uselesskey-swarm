Feature: Cache behavior
  As a test author
  I want to verify factory cache hit and miss behavior
  So that I can rely on correct caching across different seeds, labels, and specs

  # --- Cache hit: same label same spec returns cached value ---

  Scenario: RSA cache hit returns identical key material
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-hit-rsa"
    When I generate an RSA key for label "cached-rsa"
    And I generate an RSA key for label "cached-rsa" again
    Then the PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  Scenario: ECDSA cache hit returns identical key material
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-hit-ecdsa"
    When I generate an ECDSA ES256 key for label "cached-ecdsa"
    And I generate an ECDSA ES256 key for label "cached-ecdsa" again
    Then the ECDSA PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  # --- Cache miss: different labels get different keys ---

  Scenario: different labels are cache-isolated for RSA
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-miss-label-rsa"
    When I generate an RSA key for label "label-alpha"
    And I generate another RSA key for label "label-beta"
    Then the keys should have different moduli

  Scenario: different labels are cache-isolated for ECDSA
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-miss-label-ecdsa"
    When I generate an ECDSA ES256 key for label "label-alpha"
    And I generate another ECDSA ES256 key for label "label-beta"
    Then the ECDSA keys should have different public keys

  # --- Cache miss: different specs for same label ---

  Scenario: same label different HMAC specs produce different secrets
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-miss-spec-hmac"
    When I generate an HMAC HS256 secret for label "shared-hmac"
    And I generate another HMAC HS384 secret for label "shared-hmac"
    Then the HMAC secrets should be different

  # --- Cache clear then re-derive: determinism preserved ---

  Scenario: cache clear followed by re-derive gives identical RSA key
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-clear-rsa"
    When I generate an RSA key for label "clear-test"
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate an RSA key for label "clear-test" again
    Then the PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  Scenario: cache clear followed by re-derive gives identical HMAC secret
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-clear-hmac"
    When I generate an HMAC HS256 secret for label "clear-hmac"
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate an HMAC HS256 secret for label "clear-hmac" again
    Then the HMAC secrets should be identical

  Scenario: cache clear followed by re-derive gives identical token
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-clear-token"
    When I generate an API key token for label "clear-token"
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate an API key token for label "clear-token" again
    Then the token values should be identical

  # --- New factory instance: cache is empty but determinism holds ---

  Scenario: new factory instance gets cache miss but same deterministic value
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-new-factory"
    When I generate an RSA key for label "new-factory-test"
    And I switch to a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-new-factory"
    And I generate an RSA key for label "new-factory-test" again
    Then the PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  # --- Random mode cache behavior ---

  Scenario: random factory caches within session
    Given a random factory
    When I generate an RSA key for label "random-cached"
    And I generate an RSA key for label "random-cached" again
    Then the PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  Scenario: random factory cache clear produces different key
    Given a random factory
    When I generate an RSA key for label "random-clear"
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate an RSA key for label "random-clear" again
    Then the PKCS8 PEM should differ

  # --- Ed25519 cache behavior ---

  Scenario: Ed25519 cache hit returns identical key material
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-hit-ed25519"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "cached-ed25519"
    And I generate an Ed25519 key for label "cached-ed25519" again
    Then the Ed25519 PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  Scenario: different labels are cache-isolated for Ed25519
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-miss-label-ed25519"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "label-alpha"
    And I generate another Ed25519 key for label "label-beta"
    Then the Ed25519 keys should have different public keys

  Scenario: cache clear followed by re-derive gives identical ECDSA key
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-clear-ecdsa"
    When I generate an ECDSA ES256 key for label "clear-ecdsa"
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate an ECDSA ES256 key for label "clear-ecdsa" again
    Then the ECDSA PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  Scenario: cache clear followed by re-derive gives identical Ed25519 key
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-clear-ed25519"
    When I generate an Ed25519 key for label "clear-ed25519"
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate an Ed25519 key for label "clear-ed25519" again
    Then the Ed25519 PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  # --- Cross-type cache isolation ---

  Scenario: generating one key type does not invalidate another in cache
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-cross-type-isolation"
    When I generate an RSA key for label "rsa-stable"
    And I generate an ECDSA ES256 key for label "ecdsa-stable"
    And I generate an Ed25519 key for label "ed25519-stable"
    And I generate an RSA key for label "rsa-stable" again
    Then the PKCS8 PEM should be identical

  # --- Bearer and OAuth token cache behavior ---

  Scenario: cache clear followed by re-derive gives identical bearer token
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-clear-bearer"
    When I generate a bearer token for label "clear-bearer"
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate a bearer token for label "clear-bearer" again
    Then the token values should be identical

  Scenario: cache clear followed by re-derive gives identical OAuth token
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "cache-clear-oauth"
    When I generate an OAuth access token for label "clear-oauth"
    And I clear the factory cache
    And I generate an OAuth access token for label "clear-oauth" again
    Then the token values should be identical
