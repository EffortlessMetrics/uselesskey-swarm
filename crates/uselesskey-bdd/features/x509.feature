Feature: X.509 certificate fixtures
  As a test author
  I want to generate X.509 certificate fixtures
  So that I can test TLS and certificate validation without committing secrets

  # --- Determinism ---

  Scenario: deterministic X.509 certificates are stable
    Given a deterministic factory seeded with "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000042"
    When I generate an X.509 certificate for domain "test.example.com" with label "server"
    And I generate an X.509 certificate for domain "test.example.com" with label "server" again
