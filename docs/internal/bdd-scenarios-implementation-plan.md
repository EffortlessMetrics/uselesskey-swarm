## Implementation Notes

### Step Implementation Requirements

For each new scenario, the following step implementations may need to be added to [`crates/uselesskey-bdd/tests/bdd.rs`](../../crates/uselesskey-bdd/tests/bdd.rs):

1. **RSA RS384/RS512 steps**: New spec variants
2. **HMAC HS384/HS512 steps**: New spec variants
3. **JWT signing/verification steps**: Integration with jsonwebtoken
4. **TLS config steps**: Integration with rustls
5. **Edge case steps**: Label handling, cache behavior

### World State Extensions

The [`UselessWorld`](../../crates/uselesskey-bdd/tests/bdd.rs:9) struct may need additional fields:

```rust
// JWT-related fields
jwt_token: Option<String>,
jwt_claims: Option<String>,

// TLS-related fields
tls_server_config: Option<TlsServerConfig>,
tls_client_config: Option<TlsClientConfig>,
```

### Feature Flags

Some scenarios may require feature flags:
- `jwt.feature`: Requires `jsonwebtoken` feature
- `tls.feature`: Requires `rustls` features
- Edge cases: Should work with default features
