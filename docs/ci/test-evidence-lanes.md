# Test Evidence Lanes

`uselesskey` is a fixture platform for secret-shaped test systems. CI evidence
should be organized around that promise: deterministic fixtures, scanner-safe
bundle defaults, realistic negative cases, and adapter contracts should be
backed by the right proof at the right time.

The goal is not simply faster CI. The goal is to make each lane answer a clear
question without making every pull request pay release-candidate cost.

## Signal Boundaries

Different tools answer different questions:

| Signal | Question answered | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage | Did tests execute this surface? | Does not prove assertions would detect wrong behavior. |
| `ripr` | Does changed behavior appear to have a meaningful test oracle? | Static exposure signal; does not run mutants. |
| Targeted mutation | Did high-risk changed behavior survive concrete mutants? | Runtime proof for selected owner crates, not a workspace-wide default. |
| Nightly mutation | Did the broader public fixture surface gain new survivors? | Broad regression signal outside ordinary PR latency. |
| Release evidence | Can the shipped public promises be proven together? | Release-candidate proof, not day-to-day PR feedback. |

`ripr` does not replace mutation testing. Use `ripr` before mutation to route
expensive proof toward behavior that needs it, then use mutation to confirm
high-risk behavior where runtime proof matters.

## Lane 1: PR Fast Evidence

Runs on every pull request.

Purpose:

- catch build, lint, docs, support metadata, scanner-risk, and public-surface
  drift quickly;
- show whether changed behavior appears to reach a meaningful test oracle;
- keep ordinary review feedback fast enough to act on.

Typical signals:

- formatting and Clippy;
- impact-scoped tests;
- `cargo xtask docs-sync --check`;
- `cargo xtask public-surface` when topology or support metadata changes;
- `cargo xtask publish-preflight --allow-dirty` when package metadata changes;
- `cargo xtask examples-smoke` when examples or user recipes change;
- `cargo xtask no-blob` when fixture, docs, bundle, or example outputs change;
- `cargo xtask ripr-pr` for advisory `ripr` PR exposure evidence;
- `cargo xtask ripr-review-comments` for advisory line-placeable review
  guidance;
- `git diff --check`.

Blocking posture:

- normal build, lint, docs, public-surface, publish, no-blob, and example
  failures block when their affected surface is in scope;
- `ripr` should start advisory and become blocking only for severe exposure
  gaps after the baseline is stable;
- full mutation does not run here by default. Use `cargo xtask pr --with-mutants`
  or `cargo xtask mutants-pr --changed` when PR-scoped mutation is required.

## Lane 2: PR Targeted Mutation

Runs only when the change is high risk or explicitly requested.

Triggers:

- `mutation` or `release-risk` label;
- core derivation, hash, identity, seed, sink, or cache behavior changed;
- negative fixture semantics changed;
- bundle verifier, materialization, manifest, or receipt behavior changed;
- adapter conversion behavior changed;
- public owner crate internals changed;
- `ripr` reports a severe exposure gap on a public owner surface.

Scope:

- changed owner crate first;
- at most the directly affected owner crates unless the PR explicitly opts into
  a full-owner or release-risk run;
- compatibility shims use narrow import/publish proof unless their behavior is
  more than a re-export.

Blocking posture:

- targeted mutation is blocking when triggered;
- missed mutants should produce focused tests or a documented equivalent-mutant
  rationale;
- do not weaken fixture assertions or public contracts only to reduce mutant
  count.

## Lane 3: Nightly Mutation

Runs on a schedule and by manual dispatch.

Purpose:

- keep broad mutation signal without charging every PR for it;
- detect new survivor regressions across public fixture promises;
- keep a running evidence trail for release readiness.

Default scope:

- `uselesskey-core`;
- public fixture-family crates such as `uselesskey-jwk`, `uselesskey-token`,
  `uselesskey-x509`, `uselesskey-rsa`, `uselesskey-ecdsa`,
  `uselesskey-ed25519`, and `uselesskey-hmac`;
- `uselesskey-cli`;
- critical adapters when their contracts are active release promises.

Artifacts should summarize:

- mutants found;
- caught;
- survived or missed;
- unviable;
- new survivors since the last run;
- known accepted survivors with issue links.

Nightly mutation is advisory for ordinary PRs. It can become release-blocking
once the survivor ledger is classified and maintained.

Run the local scope planner with:

```bash
cargo xtask mutants-nightly --scope public --dry-run
```

The scheduled/manual workflow lives at `.github/workflows/mutation.yml`. It runs
`cargo xtask mutants-nightly`, defaults scheduled runs to `--scope public`, and
uploads `target/mutation/` as the `mutation-nightly` artifact.

Reviewed survivors are classified in `policy/mutation-survivors.toml`. The
nightly planner validates that ledger and writes `target/mutation/survivors.md`
plus `target/mutation/survivors.json`; expired classifications are reported
there until the later receipt lane can compare new cargo-mutants output against
the ledger.

The nightly lane also writes `target/mutation/nightly-receipt.json` and
`target/mutation/nightly-receipt.md`. Dry runs mark crates as `planned`; actual
scheduled/manual runs parse cargo-mutants `outcomes.json` files into found,
caught, survived, unviable, timeout, and other counts.

## Performance Evidence

Performance evidence runs in the PR/main CI perf job and in the dedicated
scheduled/manual workflow at `.github/workflows/performance.yml`.

Run the local performance evidence command with:

```bash
cargo xtask perf --compare
```

`cargo xtask perf` writes the machine-readable benchmark report to
`target/xtask/perf/latest.json`. The scheduled/manual workflow also writes a
human-readable `target/xtask/perf/latest.md` summary, uploads
`target/xtask/perf/` as the `performance-evidence` artifact, and compares the
latest report against `docs/metadata/perf-baselines.json` by default.

This lane is evidence for fixture-generation cost trends. It is runner-sensitive
and does not prove cryptographic correctness, scanner safety, or deterministic
identity by itself.

## Lane 4: Release Evidence

Runs for release branches, release candidates, or tag candidates.

Purpose:

- prove the shipped public fixture platform, not just the changed diff;
- give users and maintainers a linkable evidence package for deterministic
  fixtures, negative cases, scanner-safe bundles, adapters, and package proof.

Signals:

- full mutation on selected public owner crates;
- repository-level `ripr` exposure summary;
- `cargo xtask public-surface`;
- package proof and publish dry-runs;
- `cargo xtask bundle-proof --profile scanner-safe` for bundle generation,
  `verify-bundle`, `inspect-bundle`, export handoff, and no-blob proof;
- `cargo xtask bundle-proof --profile oidc` for OIDC contract-pack contents,
  owner-crate JWK/token tests, verifier proof, inspection, and no-blob proof;
- scanner-safe `no-blob` proof;
- docs/examples smoke;
- adapter matrix checks;
- receipt drift checks.
- scheduled/manual performance evidence.

Release evidence should produce durable Markdown and JSON artifacts that can be
linked from release notes. Plan or run the release evidence lane with:

```bash
cargo xtask release-evidence --version 0.7.0 --out target/release-evidence --summary
```

The v0.7.0 release-candidate checklist starts in
[`docs/release/evidence-matrix-v0.7.0.md`](../release/evidence-matrix-v0.7.0.md).

## Change-Type Routing

| Change type | Fast PR evidence | Targeted mutation | Nightly/release role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Docs-only policy or roadmap | Docs sync, typos, link/diff checks | No, unless examples execute behavior | Nightly unaffected. |
| User examples or bundle recipes | Examples smoke, no-blob, docs sync | Only if executable behavior changes | Release examples proof. |
| Public-surface metadata or crate topology | Public-surface, publish-preflight, docs sync | Owner mutation when behavior moved | Release matrix proof. |
| Core derivation/hash/identity | Fast gates plus deterministic regression tests | Yes, full owner mutation | Release-blocking evidence. |
| Negative fixture semantics | Owner tests plus `ripr` exposure | Yes, owner-targeted mutation | Failure-atlas proof. |
| Bundle manifest/verifier/receipts | CLI tests, bundle verify, no-blob | Yes, CLI-targeted mutation | Bundle release receipts. |
| Adapter conversion behavior | Adapter tests and examples | Yes, adapter-targeted mutation | Adapter contract proof. |
| Compatibility shim only | Import, no-default, package, metadata proof | Usually no | Release shim policy. |

## Author Workflow

For an ordinary PR:

1. Run the fast local gates for the touched surface.
2. Run `cargo xtask ripr-pr` and read `target/ripr/pr/summary.md`.
3. Add focused tests when changed behavior is weakly exposed.
4. Use targeted mutation only when the routing rules call for it.

For a high-risk PR:

1. Run the fast local gates.
2. Run `cargo xtask ripr-pr` to find missing or weak test oracles.
3. Run `cargo xtask impacted-evidence --base origin/main` to identify the
   evidence owner crates and whether targeted mutation is required.
4. Add focused tests for severe exposure gaps.
5. Run `cargo xtask mutants-pr --changed` or
   `cargo xtask mutants-pr --crate <crate> --full-owner` for the owner crate.
6. Record the exact mutation command and result in the PR body.

`cargo xtask ripr-pr` treats `ripr` as an external tool and writes advisory
artifacts under `target/ripr/pr/`:

- `repo-exposure.json`;
- `repo-exposure.md`;
- `summary.md`;
- `review.md`.

`cargo xtask ripr-pr-summary` regenerates `summary.md` from the available
machine-readable PR artifacts after `ripr` review guidance and impacted
evidence have been produced. Missing data is represented explicitly rather than
filled in from prose.

Pull request CI uploads that directory as the `ripr-pr` artifact.

`cargo xtask ripr-review-comments` runs `ripr review-comments` with explicit
root, base, head, and output paths. It writes advisory review guidance under
`target/ripr/review/`:

- `comments.json`;
- `comments.md`.

Pull request CI uploads that directory as the `ripr-review` artifact, appends
`comments.md` to the step summary, and emits non-blocking warning annotations
from `comments[]` only. `summary_only[]` stays in the summary and artifact;
inline PR comments are disabled by default.

If `ripr` is not installed, the command writes skipped artifacts with a clear
reason and exits successfully. Other `ripr` runtime failures should fail the
command so the tool integration does not silently mask bad evidence.

`cargo xtask impacted-evidence --base origin/main` writes
`target/xtask/impacted-evidence/latest.json` and prints the same JSON summary to
stdout. The summary maps changed paths to public owner crates, explains why a
path is high risk, and says whether targeted mutation is required. When
`target/ripr/pr/repo-exposure.json` exists, the same report includes a `ripr`
routing section that classifies severe exposure gaps, maps them to public owner
crate surfaces where possible, and lists the focused-test or targeted-mutation
actions expected from the PR author.

`cargo xtask mutants-pr --changed` uses the same impacted-evidence owner map.
When no high-risk owner surface changed, it exits successfully without running
mutation and prints that targeted mutation was not required. When a high-risk
surface changed, it runs mutation for the mapped owner crate(s).

Pull request CI runs `cargo xtask impacted-evidence` after `ripr-pr`, uploads
`target/xtask/impacted-evidence/` as the `impacted-evidence` artifact, and runs
`cargo xtask mutants-pr --changed` when any of these are true:

- the PR has a `mutation` label;
- the PR has a `mutation/full-owner` label, which runs
  `cargo xtask mutants-pr --changed --full-owner`;
- the PR has a `release-risk` label;
- impacted evidence marks the diff as requiring targeted mutation;
- `ripr` reports a severe exposure gap on the changed surface.

The PR workflow also writes a GitHub step summary after the evidence-producing
steps. The summary lists fast-gate statuses, RIPR counts and severe-gap routing,
targeted mutation routing, impacted owner crates, suggested actions, and the
uploaded artifact names. It is a review aid; the underlying gates and artifacts
remain the source of truth.
