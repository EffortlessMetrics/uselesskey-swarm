# Documentation

See the [project README](../README.md) for a quick start.

This documentation follows the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), organizing content by purpose:

## Architecture Decisions

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture significant design choices and their rationale.

- [ADR Index](adr/README.md) — Overview and index of all decisions
- [0001-use-adr-template.md](adr/0001-use-adr-template.md) — ADR format and process
- [0002-seed-boundary-abstraction.md](adr/0002-seed-boundary-abstraction.md) — RNG boundary abstraction for v0.4
- [0003-order-independent-determinism.md](adr/0003-order-independent-determinism.md) — Order-independent derivation design
- [0004-microcrate-architecture.md](adr/0004-microcrate-architecture.md) — Microcrate decomposition strategy

## How-to Guides

Task-oriented instructions for common workflows.

## Contributing

Repository operating rules for agents and maintainers.

## CI and Evidence

Validation lanes and the claim boundaries behind them.

- [coverage.md](ci/coverage.md) — Coverage workflow scope, artifacts, and advisory status
- [test-evidence-lanes.md](ci/test-evidence-lanes.md) — PR, targeted mutation, nightly mutation, and release evidence model

## Release

Release-candidate proof and public promise evidence.
