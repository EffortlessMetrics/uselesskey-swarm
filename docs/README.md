# Documentation

See the [project README](../README.md) for a quick start.

This documentation follows the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), organizing content by purpose:

## Architecture Decisions

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture significant design choices and their rationale.

- [ADR Index](adr/README.md) — Overview and index of all decisions
- [0001-use-adr-template.md](adr/0001-use-adr-template.md) — ADR format and process
- [0002-seed-boundary-abstraction.md](adr/0002-seed-boundary-abstraction.md) — RNG boundary abstraction for v0.4
- [0003-order-independent-determinism.md](adr/0003-order-independent-determinism.md) — Order-independent derivation design
- [0004-microcrate-architecture.md](adr/0004-microcrate-architecture.md) — Microcrate decomposition strategy

## Source of Truth

Repository operating artifacts are split by job so public claims, proof, and
agent state do not drift into one document.

- [proposals](proposals/README.md) - Why a lane exists, who benefits, and what alternatives were considered
- [specs](specs/README.md) - What behavior is promised, not promised, and how it is proven
- [status](status/README.md) - Public claim, support tier, and proof mapping indexes
- [handoffs](handoffs/README.md) - Closeout notes and operator handoffs after a lane changes state
- [learnings](learnings/README.md) - Durable lessons from releases, incidents, and proof lanes
- [plans](../plans/README.md) - PR sequencing and rollback plans
- [active goals](../.uselesskey/goals/README.md) - Machine-readable current agent lane state
- [agent bootstrap](handoffs/agent-bootstrap.md) - Read order and validation defaults for agents resuming work
