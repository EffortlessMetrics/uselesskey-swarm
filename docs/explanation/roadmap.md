# Roadmap

This roadmap reflects the strategic direction for uselesskey as a **test-fixture layer** (not a crypto library).

## Now (v0.7.0)

*Rust 1.95 scanner-safe fixture platform release hardening*

- [x] Ship the lane-choice release: entropy, runtime fixtures, and build-time materialization.
- [x] Add economics and audit-surface receipts as first-class CI artifacts.
- [x] Refresh advisory-blocked dependency floors so PR checks start from a clean security baseline.
- [x] Finish PR queue disposition: merge reviewed keepers, close superseded duplicates, and park broken dependency bumps with explicit rationale.
- [x] Keep mutation-proof coverage aligned with fixture identity and shape contracts for touched crates.

## Next (after v0.7.0)

*Planned follow-up*

- [x] JWK/JWKS and token-shape negative fixture follow-ons.
- [x] Docs/examples coverage for the remaining negative-fixture surface.
- [x] Performance benchmarks for key generation and materialization paths.
- [x] Export-bundle CLI integration: `uselesskey bundle`, `verify-bundle`,
  scanner-safe profile metadata, deterministic receipts, and Kubernetes/Vault
  payload emitters.
- [x] Release governance and post-release audit automation.
- [x] Release-facing reference bundle manifests and downstream fixture recipes.

## Shipped

### v0.6.0 (2026-04-08)

*Lane-choice, materialization, and release economics*

- Added `uselesskey-entropy` for deterministic high-entropy byte fixtures and scanner-safe placeholder data.
- Added `uselesskey-cli materialize` / `verify` manifest workflows, including build-time `OUT_DIR` examples for shape-only fixtures and explicit RSA PKCS#8 materialization.
- Added `cargo xtask economics` and `cargo xtask audit-surface` so lane cost and advisory-island receipts are generated as repo artifacts.
- Reframed public docs around lane choice first: entropy, token, runtime semantic fixtures, and build-time materialized fixtures.

### v0.5.1 (2026-03-27)

*X.509 negative-fixture expansion and dependency-lane stabilization*

- Added the first X.509 chain-negative wave for not-yet-valid fixtures and
  intermediate path-validation failures, while preserving default deterministic
  certificate outputs.
- Landed the queued maintenance dependency refreshes, including `toml`,
  `insta`, and `sha2`, plus the supporting RustCrypto/HMAC compatibility fixes
  needed to keep adapters, fuzz targets, and CI aligned.
- Prepared the `0.5.1` release manifests, changelog, and release-facing
  dependency snippets.

### v0.5.0 (2026-03-25)

*Adapter-wave release and docs/infrastructure alignment*

- Added a reusable adapter-scaffold template and established adapter acceptance
  requirements.
- Added `uselesskey-jose-openid` and `uselesskey-pgp-native` adapter
  microcrates with runtime examples and smoke/integration coverage.
- Added docs metadata source, `docs-sync`, and examples-smoke coverage to PR
  checks, and aligned release-facing docs to avoid drift.

### v0.4.0 (2026-03)

*RNG boundary cleanup and API hardening*

- [x] Hide rand ABI behind seed boundaries
- [x] Public API no longer leaks rand types
- [x] `Seed` is now the stable boundary between user code and RNG
  implementation
- [x] Support crates and fuzz targets consume the seed-oriented helper APIs

### v0.3.0 (2026-03)

*Facade ergonomics and lightweight token path*

- [x] Empty facade defaults (no default features)
- [x] Token-only lightweight path
- [x] `Seed::from_text` for ergonomic seed creation
- [x] `Factory::deterministic_from_str` convenience method
- [x] Dogfooding smoke coverage via test fixtures
- [x] Updated documentation and README examples

  - Root CA -> Intermediate -> Leaf
  - Deterministic serial numbers and validity periods
  - Chain PEM (leaf + intermediate, no root) for standard TLS server usage

- [x] Tempfile outputs with restrictive permissions
- [x] Negative fixtures: corrupt PEM, truncated DER, mismatched keypairs

## Non-goals

These are explicitly out of scope:

- Production key management
- Hardware-backed keys (HSM, TPM)
- Rotation servers or key lifecycle management
- Perfect scanner evasion (if a scanner flags runtime output, that's a downstream issue)
- Signing/verification APIs (artifacts only)

## Versioning Policy

- **Derivation stability**: Changing the derivation algorithm requires bumping the derivation version field. Existing tests should not break.
- **Semver**: Breaking API changes bump the minor version until 1.0, then major version.
- **Feature flags**: New key types are opt-in via Cargo features to keep compile times reasonable.
