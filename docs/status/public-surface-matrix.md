# Public Surface Matrix

Source-of-truth artifact id: `USELESSKEY-STATUS-public-surface-matrix`

This page is the compact status view for public crate promises. The architecture
policy lives in [`docs/architecture/public-surface.md`](../architecture/public-surface.md),
and the generated support table lives in
[`docs/reference/support-matrix.md`](../reference/support-matrix.md).

Rule:

```text
Public crates are user promises.
Workspace-only crates are load-bearing structure.
```

## Boundary

This matrix does not demote or remove crates. Public-surface changes that affect
publish status, support tier, or semver expectations must update the generated
support matrix, `docs/metadata/workspace-docs.json`, and the release story in a
separate release-aware PR.
