# Verify `uselesskey` Public Claims

Use this guide when you need to show a reviewer what `uselesskey` claims, which
commands prove those claims, and where the receipts are written.

The quick rule:

```text
README badge -> public claim -> claim report -> claim proof -> verification pack
```

## 1. Read the Claim Index

Start with the human-facing claim index:

```text
docs/status/PUBLIC_CLAIMS.md
```

Then generate the machine-readable report from the ledger:

```bash
cargo xtask claim-report
```

The command writes:

```text
target/claim-report/public-claims.md
target/claim-report/public-claims.json
```

Release evidence also carries a copy under:

```text
target/release-evidence/claims/public-claims.md
target/release-evidence/claims/public-claims.json
```

For a single claim:

```bash
cargo xtask claim-report --claim scanner-safe-fixtures
cargo xtask claim-report --claim webhook-contract-pack
```

## 2. Check the Human Page Against the Ledger

`docs/status/PUBLIC_CLAIMS.md` is hand-written so it can stay readable. The
ledger under `policy/claim-ledger.toml` is the parser target.

Check that the page still matches the ledger:

```bash
cargo xtask claim-report --check-public-claims
```

This fails if a stable ledger claim is missing from the page, if the page
references an unknown claim id, if status drifted, if proof commands are not
visible, or if a boundary cell is empty.

## 3. Verify README Badge Claims

The README badge row is a front panel. The generated endpoint JSON is the public
receipt.

```bash
cargo xtask badges --check
```

This checks:

```text
badges/ripr-plus.json
badges/scanner-safe.json
```

`ripr+` is repo-scoped static evidence plus test-efficiency debt. It is not
coverage, runtime mutation proof, or correctness proof.

`scanner-safe fixtures` means repository policy found no committed
secret-shaped fixture blobs. It does not mean every generated export is safe to
commit.

## 4. Verify Scanner-Safe Fixture Claims

For a single runnable receipt, use the allowlisted claim-proof runner:

```bash
cargo xtask claim-proof --claim scanner-safe-fixtures
```

The receipt is written under:

```text
target/claim-proof/scanner-safe-fixtures/
```

To run the underlying checks directly:

```bash
cargo xtask scanner-safe-reference --check
cargo xtask no-blob
cargo xtask badges --check
```

Use these when the reviewer is asking whether the repo has committed
secret-shaped fixture blobs under the configured policy.

Do not use this as proof of production key safety, scanner evasion, or
cryptographic assurance.

## 5. Verify the TLS Contract Pack

Check that stable contract packs are registered against claims, specs, how-tos,
release lanes, and proof commands:

```bash
cargo xtask contract-packs --check
```

Run the TLS bundle proof:

```bash
cargo xtask bundle-proof --profile tls --out target/release-evidence/tls
```

For a single runnable claim receipt:

```bash
cargo xtask claim-proof --claim tls-contract-pack
```

Attach these receipts:

```text
target/claim-proof/tls-contract-pack/receipt.md
target/claim-proof/tls-contract-pack/receipt.json
target/release-evidence/tls/tls-contract-pack-proof.md
target/release-evidence/tls/tls-contract-pack-proof.json
target/release-evidence/contract-packs/contract-packs.md
target/release-evidence/contract-packs/contract-packs.json
```

This proves the documented generated TLS fixtures, receipts, and negative
validation paths. It does not prove mTLS, revocation, certificate transparency,
browser trust-store behavior, production CA custody, or downstream verifier
correctness.

## 6. Verify the Webhook Contract Pack

Use this path when a reviewer wants proof that the generated webhook fixtures
exercise deterministic HMAC verifier behavior and documented negative classes.

Check the registry:

```bash
cargo xtask contract-packs --check
```

Run the webhook bundle proof:

```bash
cargo xtask bundle-proof --profile webhook --out target/release-evidence/webhook
```

For a single runnable claim receipt:

```bash
cargo xtask claim-proof --claim webhook-contract-pack
```

For a metadata-only review bundle:

```bash
cargo xtask verification-pack --out target/uselesskey-verification --claim webhook-contract-pack
```

Attach these receipts:

```text
target/claim-proof/webhook-contract-pack/receipt.md
target/claim-proof/webhook-contract-pack/receipt.json
target/release-evidence/webhook/webhook-contract-pack-proof.md
target/release-evidence/webhook/webhook-contract-pack-proof.json
target/uselesskey-verification/README.md
target/uselesskey-verification/claim-proof/webhook-contract-pack/receipt.md
target/uselesskey-verification/claim-proof/webhook-contract-pack/receipt.json
```

This proves the documented generic HMAC webhook verifier fixture paths:
valid signature acceptance, tampered body rejection, wrong secret rejection,
stale timestamp rejection, missing signature rejection, and malformed signature
rejection. It does not prove production webhook provider compatibility, secret
rotation, delivery retry behavior, replay protection completeness, transport
security, or downstream verifier correctness.

## 7. Verify the Published Install Path

For the current published release:

```bash
cargo xtask cratesio-smoke --version 0.8.0
```

For a future release, replace `0.8.0` with the version under review.

This proves an external crates.io install path for that version. It does not
prove every downstream feature combination, docs.rs completion, or future
registry state.

## 8. Attach Review Evidence

For the full reviewer bundle:

```bash
cargo xtask verification-pack --out target/uselesskey-verification
```

For a security, platform, or release review, attach:

```text
target/uselesskey-verification/README.md
target/uselesskey-verification/public-claims.md
target/uselesskey-verification/public-claims.json
target/uselesskey-verification/contract-packs.md
target/uselesskey-verification/contract-packs.json
target/uselesskey-verification/claim-proof/*/receipt.md
target/uselesskey-verification/claim-proof/*/receipt.json
target/claim-report/public-claims.md
target/claim-report/public-claims.json
target/release-evidence/tls/tls-contract-pack-proof.md
target/release-evidence/tls/tls-contract-pack-proof.json
target/release-evidence/webhook/webhook-contract-pack-proof.md
target/release-evidence/webhook/webhook-contract-pack-proof.json
```

Also include the commands you ran and the exact version, branch, or commit under
review.

The verification pack contains metadata and receipts only. Do not attach
generated fixture payloads such as PEM, DER, JWT, or key files.

## Boundaries to Keep Visible

- Public claims are command-backed, not trust-by-README.
- README badges are repo-scoped public markers, not PR evidence.
- PR `ripr` artifacts are diff-scoped and advisory.
- Scanner-safe fixture material is not production key management.
- Contract packs prove documented fixture paths, not complete downstream
  security behavior.
