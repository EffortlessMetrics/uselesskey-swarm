# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the uselesskey project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs provide:

- **Historical context**: Why was a particular decision made?
- **Onboarding aid**: New contributors can understand the architecture quickly
- **Decision log**: A chronological record of significant architectural choices

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue or question being addressed?
- **Decision**: What is the change or approach being taken?
- **Consequences**: What are the positive and negative outcomes?
- **Alternatives Considered**: What other options were evaluated?

New source-of-truth ADRs should also include TOML front matter with a stable
`USELESSKEY-ADR-XXXX` ID. Existing numbered ADRs remain valid historical
records; do not renumber them only to adopt the newer template.

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `0001-use-adr-template.md` to a new file
2. Increment the number (use the next available sequence number)
3. Create a short, kebab-case title (e.g., `0005-add-new-feature.md`)
4. Fill in all sections
5. Submit with your pull request

For spec-system work, start from [the ADR template](../templates/adr.md) and
use a stable `USELESSKEY-ADR-XXXX` ID in the front matter.

### Naming Convention

```
NNNN-short-title.md
```

- `NNNN`: Zero-padded sequence number (0001, 0002, etc.)
- `short-title`: Brief, kebab-case description of the decision
